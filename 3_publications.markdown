This page presents the main **research outputs** of the group, including
peer-reviewed [**scientific publications**](#publications) and [**research software**](#research-software-and-open-tools) developed
in close connection with our experimental and methodological work.
Together, these outputs reflect our commitment to **quantitative science,
reproducibility, and open research practices** in microfluidics, droplets,
and immunology.

## Research Software and Open Tools

We develop **open-source and custom software tools** in direct support of our
research activities in **image analysis, microfluidics, and data science**.
These tools are designed to enable **quantitative analysis**, facilitate
**reproducibility**, and support both research and training activities.

You can find most of the codes developed or and used in publications on our [Github account](https://github.com/fattacciolilab){:target="_blank"}

### Open science and reuse

Whenever possible, software tools, scripts, and notebooks are shared through
open repositories or teaching material. This approach supports **open science**,
**method sharing**, and **lifelong learning programs in microfluidics**.
