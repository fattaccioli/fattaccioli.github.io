# About

I am **Jacques Fattaccioli**, **Associate Professor in Chemistry**. I am part of the **MesoBioLab** team within the [**CPCV Laboratory**](https://cpcv-beta.vercel.app/) at [**École Normale Supérieure](https://www.ens.psl.eu/) (ENS-PSL), [Department of Chemistry](https://www.chimie.ens.fr/) (Paris, France)**. My work sits at the interface of **microfluidics, soft matter, biophysics, and immunology**, with a strong emphasis on **droplet-based microfluidic systems**. We design microfluidic platforms and surface/interface strategies to generate and functionalize droplets, control microscale environments, and build quantitative experiments that connect physico-chemical principles to biologically relevant questions.

## Research interests

Our research focuses on **microfluidic engineering and droplet technologies** for quantitative bio-physical chemistry, including the controlled manipulation of **droplets, interfaces, particles, and cells**. A key direction is the development of microfluidic approaches for **immunology**, where droplet microcompartments and tailored surface chemistries enable precise control of biochemical conditions and cell–interface interactions for **single-cell and high-throughput assays**.

## Teaching and training

I teach at the **Bachelor and Master level** in chemistry and related disciplines, with a strong emphasis on hands-on quantitative skills:

- **Python programming for science and chemistry**
- **Image analysis** and quantitative data analysis
- **Microscopy** (experimental practice and data extraction)
- **Microfluidics and microfabrication** (Master level in Chemistry)

I am in charge of the **Microfluidics and Miniaturization Master**: https://microfluidics-master.fr/

In addition to university teaching, I develop and deliver **lifelong learning** and professional training programs in **microfluidics**, tailored to R&D teams.
