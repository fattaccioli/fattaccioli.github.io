## University teaching (Bachelor and Master levels)

I teach at the **Bachelor and Master levels** in chemistry and related disciplines at Sorbonne Université and partner institutions. My courses aim to provide students with **strong methodological foundations** while progressively introducing **research-oriented practices**.

Teaching themes include:
- **Python programming for science and chemistry**
- **Image analysis** and quantitative data analysis
- **Microscopy** and experimental data extraction
- **Microfluidics and microfabrication** for chemical and biological applications

Across these courses, the emphasis is placed on:
- hands-on work on real experimental data,
- quantitative reasoning and physical intuition,
- autonomy in data analysis and interpretation.

## Teaching unit — Master of Chemistry (Sorbonne Université)

### UM5CI230 — Miniaturisation pour la caractérisation et l’analyse

This teaching unit introduces how **miniaturisation fundamentally changes the way chemical and biological samples are measured, transported, separated, and analysed**. The course connects **core physical principles at small scales**—such as laminar flows, diffusion, interfaces, and surface effects—to the design and operation of **lab-on-a-chip and microanalytical systems**.

Key concepts and applications include **microfabrication**, microfluidic networks, gradients, droplets, extraction processes, electrophoresis, electrochemical detection, and **miniaturised spectroscopy** (IR and Raman).

### Learning outcomes

By the end of the unit, students are expected to be able to:
- Reason using **scaling laws and dimensionless numbers** (Reynolds, Péclet, Capillary numbers, etc.)
- Analyse and design **microfluidic networks** (hydraulic resistances, flow distribution, gradient generators)
- Explain **on-chip analytical techniques**, including capillary electrophoresis (CE), liquid–liquid extraction (LLE), solid-phase extraction (SPE), and electrode-based detection
- Discuss the **constraints of miniaturised spectroscopy** (IR/Raman) and mitigation strategies (preconcentration, SERS)
- Propose a coherent **“sample → answer” microdevice** under point-of-care constraints (time, cost, robustness)

### Course format

- **Lectures**: physical concepts, key examples, and design trade-offs  
- **Tutorials**: problem solving and quantitative reasoning  
- **Laboratory classes (2 sessions)**: hands-on experiments on mixing, gradients, and droplets  
- **Mini-project**: quantitative measurement of capillary wicking using a Washburn-type analysis  

### Assessment

The final exam is **open-PDF**: course documents are accessible during the exam. Evaluation therefore focuses on **reasoning quality**, **problem structuring**, and the **correct use of physical models, assumptions, and orders of magnitude**.

## Microfluidics and Miniaturization Master — Program management

I am in charge of the **Microfluidics and Miniaturization Master**, an interdisciplinary program dedicated to **microfluidics, lab-on-a-chip technologies, and miniaturised analytical systems**.

The program is designed for students from **chemistry, physics, engineering, and biology**, and combines **fundamental concepts**, **hands-on experimental training**, and **application-driven projects**.

### Curriculum overview

The curriculum covers:
- Fundamentals of **microfluidics and transport at small scales**
- **Droplet-based microfluidics** and interface engineering
- Microfabrication and device design
- Imaging, microscopy, and quantitative data analysis
- Chemical and biological applications of lab-on-chip systems
- Project-based learning and internships in academic or industrial environments

Teaching is provided by **faculty from ENS, Sorbonne Université, and partner institutions**, complemented by **invited lecturers from industry and applied research**.

## Lifelong learning and professional training

In addition to university teaching, I develop and deliver **lifelong learning programs** in **microfluidics** for professionals and R&D teams.

These training activities focus on:
- understanding microfluidic concepts and design principles,
- experimental strategies and limitations,
- translating microfluidic technologies to real-world applications.

### Example: 12-hour professional training format (microfluidics)

To give a concrete overview of the scope and structure of our professional training activities, the following outlines a **typical 12-hour lifelong learning program in microfluidics**. The content and emphasis can be adapted depending on the background and objectives of the participants.

**Target audience**  
R&D engineers, researchers, and technical staff in chemistry, physics, biology, or engineering.

**Format**  
12 hours total (e.g. 4 × 3 h sessions or 2 × 6 h sessions), delivered on-site or remotely.

- **Module 1 — Fundamentals of microfluidics**  
- **Module 2 — Droplet-based microfluidics**  
- **Module 3 — Design, fabrication, and experimentation**  
- **Module 4 — Applications, data analysis, and translation**

This syllabus is indicative and can be tailored to application domains or participant profiles.

## Teaching philosophy

Across all levels, my teaching approach aims to:
- connect **fundamental concepts** with **experimental practice**,
- promote **quantitative and critical thinking**,
- prepare students and professionals to engage with **research-driven and interdisciplinary environments**.

Teaching is conceived as a continuous pathway, from initial university training to advanced professional development.
